# USDe/sUSDe Yield Optimization Engine Subsection

Automated vault platform for maximizing USDe/sUSDe yields on Converge.

## Setup
1. Frontend: cd frontend && npm install && npm start
2. Backend: cd backend && pip install flask numpy scipy requests && python server.py
3. Contracts: Use Hardhat to deploy on Converge testnet.

## Ethena Pitch
The USDe/sUSDe Yield Optimization Engine is an automated vault platform that maximizes risk-adjusted yields on Converge by aggregating opportunities from Strata, Terminal, and Ethereal. It uses ML for portfolio optimization (Sharpe ratio rebalancing), smart contract execution for gas-efficient trades, and customizable vaults to deliver 20-30%+ APY with built-in safeguards, driving TVL growth for Ethena's ecosystem.
